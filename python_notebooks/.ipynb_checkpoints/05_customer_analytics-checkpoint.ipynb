    "CDNOW is a company that sold CDs online. It was started in 1994, but it closed after the dot-com bust of the late 90s. The dataset that we have comes from the transactions made by a **single cohort** of customers at this online store. The single cohort of customers is defined by customers who made their first purchase within the first 12 weeks of 1997. These customers are then tracked until June 30th 1998. Each row in our dataset consists of the customer id, week of purchase, quantity of CDs purchased and the amount spent in that week. There are 23,570 customers in this cohort and 64,258 transactions in this dataset. Let's read in the dataset first."

On the other hand, if a customer changes from 531 to 555, the customer has the potential to be a loyal one. It is worthwhile to send them a note or a discount voucher to reward them."

    "### How Does The Clustering Algorithm Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dissimilarity Measures Between Individual Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, cluster analysis tries to identify groups such that those within a group are \"similar\" to one another. In order to proceed, we need to formalise this idea of similarity/dissimilarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, we have $N$ observations $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N$ and we wish to group them into $K$ clusters. Each observation is typically a vector of $p$ observed values, so we may write $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{ip})$ for instance. Referring back to our CD example, we had $N=23570$ customers, and we had engineered $p=3$ features: recency, frequency and monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most clustering algorithms require a dissimilarity matrix as input, so we need a function that can measure **pairwise dissimilarity**. One of the most common choices is the Euclidean distance (or rather the $L_2$-norm) between $x_i$ and $x_j$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d(x_i,\\;x_j) = \\bigg\\{\\sum_{s=1}^p (x_{is} - x_{js})^2\\bigg\\}^{1/2}\n",

    "Another common choice is the $L_1$-norm:\n",

    "d(x_i,\\;x_j) = \\sum_{s=1}^p |x_{is} - x_{js}|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dissimilarity Measures Between Clusters or Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "For hierarchical clustering, we need to build on this choice of pairwise dissimilarity to obtain a measure of dissimilarity between groups. In other words, suppose we have two groups of points $G$ and $H$, with $N_G$ and $N_H$ points within them respectively. We wish to use the pairwise dissimilarity between points in $G$ and $H$, to compute a dissimilarity between $G$ and $H$. We call this the **linkage method**, and there are several options for this too:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single linkage takes the intergroup dissimilarity to be that of the closest (least dissimilar) pair.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d_S(G,H) = \\min_{i \\in G, j \\in H} d(x_i,\\, x_j)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "2. Complete linkage takes the intergroup dissimilarity to be that of the furthest (most dissimilar) pair.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d_C(G,H) = \\max_{i \\in G, j \\in H} d(x_i,\\, x_j)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "3. Average linkage utilises the average of all pairwise dissimilarities between the groups:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d_A(G,H) = \\frac{1}{N_G N_H} \\sum_{i \\in G} \\sum_{j \\in H} d(x_i,x_j)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "4. Ward linkage uses a more complicated distance to minimise the variance within groups. It usually returns more compact clusters than the others. Suppose that group $G$ was formed by merging groups $G_1$ and $G_2$. Then the Ward distance between groups is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d_W(G,H) = \\left\\{\\frac{|H| + |G_1|}{N_G + N_H}d_W(H,G_1)^2 + \\frac{|H| + |G_2|}{N_G + N_H}d_W(H,G_2)^2 + \\frac{|H|}{N_G +N_H}d_W(G_1,G_2)^2\\right\\}^{1/2}\n",

    "\n",
    "Market basket analysis is taught in many books, and there are many papers on the algorithms to derive the association rules from huge databases. However, you will find comparatively less papers and articles on the success from using Market Basket Analysis (an exception is the Target story).\n",

    "There could be a reason for this. Suppose that a store finds that two brands of soft drink (A and B) are often bought together. Hence, they decide to run a promotion on brand A, hoping that it would trigger an increase in the sales of brand B. Instead, the sales of brand B dropped dramatically!!?\n",
    "\n",
